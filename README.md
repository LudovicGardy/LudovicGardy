<h1 align="center">Bridging Code and Data for Strategic Innovation 👨🏻‍💻🌉🔬</h1>

<h2>Hello 🫡</h2>

<p>
Data Scientist | Seasoned freelance Data Engineer, I specialize in transforming data into strategic solutions for businesses. I developed my curriculum with a vision and a strategy: to develop the highest level of scientific culture and technical skills to act on data at different levels, with precision and surgical efficiency.

My product-oriented vision ensures the delivery of solutions that meet pragmatic constraints based on your needs, available financing, emergencies, scalability and regulatory issues specific to your sector. I do not prioritize the value of tasks and projects: studying trends and KPIs or developing cutting-edge technological solutions have, in my eyes, the same exploitation and development potential.

A lifelong learner and a man of action at the same time, I attach as much importance to technical excellence as to the maintainability and documentation of the solutions I develop. The quality of our relationship, my deliverables and your return on investment are at the heart of my priorities.
